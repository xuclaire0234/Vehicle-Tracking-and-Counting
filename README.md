# Vehicle-Tracking-and-Counting
This project implements vehicle tracking and counting using a pre-trained YOLOv8 object detection model combined with the Supervision framework. The objective is to annotate and track vehicles from a video, count them as they cross a defined line, and visualize the results with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
